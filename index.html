        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Born in 1959, Anders-Peter Mathiasen initially studied at Aarhus
          University as a history major from 1979 to 1982. After graduating,
          Anders decided to pursue his passion for journalism, which he studied
          at the Danish School of Media and Journalism, graduating in 1986.
          Anders then went on to spend nearly two decades as a journalist and
          editor for various influential media corporations around Denmark,
          including Ekstra Bladet, Politiken, Jyllands-Posten and DR (Danish
          Broadcasting Corporation).
        </p>

        <p>
          During Anders' career, Anders became known for his investigative
          journalism. Anders won the prestigious Cavling Prize, the highest
          honor in Danish journalism, in 1989 and finally in 2004. Over the
          course of his career, he would go on to author and co-author numerous
          books covering everything from organized crime to Danish political
          scandals. Among his works are <em>Dan Lynge</em>,
          <em>Mit dobbeltliv</em>, <em>Blekingegadebanden</em>,
          <em>Politiets hemmeligheder</em>, and <em>Den danske underverden</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Perhaps Anders' most famous work is <em>Det Bedste Bud</em> (The Best
          Offer), which was published by People's Press. The book covers Anders'
          investigation of the controversial 2014 sale of Dong Energy shares to
          Goldman Sachs, a deal which was pushed by finance minister Bjarne
          Corydon.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of his most widely discussed books is <em>Det Bedste Bud</em> (The
          Best Offer), published by People's Press. In it, Anders investigated
          the controversial 2014 sale of Dong Energy shares to Goldman Sachs, a
          deal pushed by Danish finance minister Bjarne Corydon. According to
          Anders, the sale was originally framed as for the good of Denmark, but
          Anders' reporting revealed a darker side of secrecy, heavily redacted
          government documents, and a transaction that benefitted top political
          and executives rather than the Danish public. The sale was described
          by politicians as "the best for Denmark," but Anders' reporting
          revealed a darker side: secrecy, heavily redacted government
          documents, and a transaction that many argued primarily benefitted
          foreign investors and top executives rather than the Danish public.
        </p>

        <p>
          After spending decades working for others, Anders wanted his own
          freedom. In 2005, he founded his own publishing and production company
          called Haddock Press, along with a cofounder. The company then
          operated successfully for years until Anders decided to shut it down,
          along with his retirement two years ago.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I met with Anders during core course week, he reflected not only
          on the professional aspect of his journey, but also the lessons he
          learned regarding freedom, creativity and responsibility.

        <h2>Interview</h2>

        <div class="question-block">
          <h3>
            Q1: What's your story before starting Haddock Press, and what made
            you want to become an entrepreneur?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Anders explained that while there were many reasons as to why he
            wanted to start his own publication, the main reason was simple. "At
            some point, I realized I didn't want bosses anymore," he told me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of choosing to climb the journalism hierarchy, Anders chose
            the freedom of independence. "Becoming my own boss meant I could
            choose what stories to tell and how to tell them," he explained.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
          <h3>Q2: What was the initial idea for your business?</h3>
          <p>
            The original vision for Haddock Press was a wide range of services.
            Anders and his cofounder wanted an agency that was broad enough to
            cover not just journalism stories, but also tv production, books,
            and other various forms of journalism that weren't covered by
            traditional media. "We wanted to do a broad kind of journalism,"
            Anders expressed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company was less about rigid structure, and more about the
            adaptability of being able to create whatever form of media he
            wished to build. And perhaps most importantly of all, "to not have
            bosses".
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
          <h3>
            Q3: Has your business idea changed over time? What is the current
            business model or mission?
          </h3>
          <p>
            "Honestly, not much changed," Anders admitted. Unlike many other
            startups that pivot, the unique edge that Anders and his cofounder
            had were their already established reputations within the journalism
            world. "Because of the reputation we had in our line of work, people
            often came to us with the work," Anders explained.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their mission remained the same throughout, telling stories in ways
            that reflected their own personal voices, unswayed by others.
            Sometimes Anders worked alone, other times he collaborated with
            cofounders or partners, depending on the project.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
          <h3>Q4: What was the hardest part of starting your business?</h3>
          <p>Without hesitation, Anders laughed and said: "Taxes."</p>
          <p>
            The biggest challenge wasn't writing books, securing interviews, or
            producing content, it was the bureaucracy.
          </p>
          <p>
            For someone who was so skilled in his craft, Anders found managing
            the administrative side of entrepreneurship to have the steepest
            learning curve. When it came to creating journalistic content, it
            was something he was already very familiar with.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
          <h3>Q5: How did you make your product/service stand out?</h3>
          <p>
            Anders credited his and his partner's personal reputations as the
            main differentiator. "We had a unique edge because of our
            personalities," he remarked.
          </p>
          <p>
            While most other businesses would seek out their clients, in Anders'
            case, clients sought him and his company out because they trusted
            him and his partners' services. "People came to us because of who we
            were, not just what we produced," he said.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="question-block">
          <h3>
            Q6: What are the most important lessons you've learned from starting
            your own business?
          </h3>
          <p>
            "The most important lesson was to fight for myself," Anders said.
            "When you're an employee, you get your money every month and you
            don't have to think about anything besides projects," he explained.
          </p>
          <p>
            While some might like this life, Anders remarked that he found the
            monotony of this life boring. "It's like jumping from break to
            break," he explained, like life was an endless cycle of starting and
            ending projects, waiting for the next holiday, and then repeating
            the cycle for eternity.
          </p>
          <p>
            In stark contrast, the life of an entrepreneur is riskier. You never
            know how much you're getting paid, and you never know when the next
            paycheck is coming in. Through this, Anders learned an important
            lesson: to always advocate for himself, whether it be through
            negotiating contracts or interacting with clients.
          </p>

        <div class="question-block">
          <h3>
            Q7: What's one piece of advice you would give yourself if you could
            go back in time to when you first began your business?
          </h3>
          <p>"Believe in it," Anders said immediately.</p>
          <p>
            Looking back, he considers himself fortunate that Haddock Press grew
            smoothly. "I was quite happy, and also pretty lucky," he reflected.

        <h2>Reflection and Takeaways</h2>
        <p>
          Interviewing Anders was a reminder to me of the different types of
          entrepreneurship present in our world. When I think of
          entrepreneurship, what often comes to mind is either f&b, tech or a
          finance company and so I found it extremely interesting to hear about
          Anders' journalism agency.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another aspect I found interesting was the story that Anders had was
          vastly different from the other entrepreneurs we met during core
          course week. Unlike them, Anders never iterated on his business, nor
          did he have to actively seek out clients. It was a powerful reminder
          that sometimes, if a product or service is good enough, the product or
          service itself will generate its own marketing.
        </p>

        <p>
          For me, Anders' journey emphasises the idea that not every
          entrepreneurial journey is the same. For some, like Anders', the
          company never pivoted, nor did it have to chase growth. Haddock Press
          remained consistent during its operation due to its founders'
          reputation, and because they stayed true to their principles and
          mission.
        </p>

        <p>
          More broadly though, Anders' reflections still apply to any
          entrepreneur. Be ready to do the "boring" work, such as taxes, be
          ready to fight for yourself, and be ready to live a riskier life. Most
          importantly, trust in yourself, and believe in the vision you have for
          your business. In doing so, one unlocks the freedom to tell their own
          story, in their own way.
